## Pac-Man Game
Pac-Man is a maze chase video game; the player controls the eponymous character through an enclosed maze. 
The objective of the game is to eat all of the dots placed in the maze while avoiding four colored ghosts — Blinky (red), Pinky (pink), Inky (cyan), 
and Clyde (orange) — that pursue him. When all of the dots are eaten, the player advances to the next level. 
If Pac-Man makes contact with a ghost, he will lose a life; the game ends when all lives are lost.

This is accurate remake of the original game. link to my active deployment
