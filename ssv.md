Operator Fee

Operators set their own fees - denominated in SSV tokens - to be charged per each validator that selects them as one of their operators.

In order to run the SSV Node, in a server, only Docker engine is necessary.

## **Generate Operator Keys**

docker run -it --rm bloxstaking/ssv-node:latest /go/bin/ssvnode generate-operator-keys
